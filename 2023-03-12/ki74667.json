It's about doing the work of humanity to affect people's life in a positive way. its about reaching out to the poor and less privilege through my wealth.. meanwhile I need to introduce myself very well for you to understand me: My name is Les Scadding, from UK, I am 71 years, use to be an unemployed mechanic until in 2009 when luck smiled on me in 2009 at the age of 58 then. I was the winner of Euro millions Lottery of 2009 where i scooped the amazing sum of \u00a345million. you can check it out here on my Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Scadding) I was 58 then. I have three kids Lisa, Nicola, and Daniel. Having been lucky to win the above mentioned sum in 2009, I settled all my kids and made them millionaires through my winning sum. Then i made some few donations to my church and bought a few properties. I also has an existing and running foundation Haven House foundation (https://www.havenhouse.org.uk) doing great through people like you which is why I want to spread more of this noble project through you.\nThen the rest of the fund where handed over to wealth and assets management Inc for a good investment, which has currently accumulated about \u00a325 Million both capital and return on investment ( ROI)......\nNow I am battling with a testicular cancer which i beat years ago but later it resurfaced again. This was discovered when i had my last medical test this year. My doctors advised that i should be taken to a hospice cos he said i got a few time here on earth.. Under this premises, I resolved to dole out the entire money that i have left from the lottery money with the wealth and assets to god fearing and non-greedy person for the purpose of starting a humanitarian project with it; that would immortalize me when am gone. like i said before, i have settled all my children and therefore have nothing to do with this. The physical property i bought will surely be \"bequeathed\" to them in my attested \"WILL\" which will be amended as soon as i found a reliable person to champion this course. I want this money to be used to touched people's life mostly the less privileged, orphans, destitute etc. it was by god's grace that i won that lottery when i had nothing, therefore it would be wise that i give it back to the society in total appreciation of god's grace and love upon my life. I am contacting you to seek for your unalloyed dedicated and devoted cooperation to handle this fund for the purpose of floating a humanitarian project with it..I know this might sound weird or strange to you but its the fact and reality which you will find out when i unveiled some vital information to you about this......\nIf you can handle the fund to effect life positively, mostly at this chaos situation of the world, marred with different kinds of transmissible diseases like corona, monkey pox etc. most especially the displaced person of the war and natural disasters in the world and also the global food and energy shortage.., don't hesitate to write me back so that I can let you know what is required of you to execute this mission. of course certain percentage of the money will be allotted to you for your sincere and selfless service. and please note that I don't need a penny from you during this period cos there would be no need for that.
