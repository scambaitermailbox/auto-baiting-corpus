Hence, I know that you may be faced with the problem of \"whom do you know\"?\nI know I can help you by gradual remittance process of about $150,000.00 to $300,000.00 in each transaction with a \"Proxy Disk\".But it has to be kept confidential because this is a  personal\n arrangement and nobody knows it except me and i will do it perfectly and you will receive your fund once you promise to keep it confidential!Let me know what you think about this.I will need a scan copy of your international passport or national id card/ drivers license, any of this three is accepted.\nAs I have stated above that this payment process cost money if you know your not ready to comply kindly don't reply because I will not respond to you.\nPlease re/confirm your account detail to avoid making  transfer to wrong account.\nRemain Bless,\n Engr.Jide Jalowo   \n", "From: j*****o@gmail.com\nTo: ot71106@m**************m\nTime: 2023-04-10 16:28:52\nSUBJECT: Re: Dear sir,\nAttn:Mr.Jeffrey,\nThank you for accepting my proposal to remit your funds  gradually with the\nProxy Disc and please bear with me for this long reply which will give you\nfull understanding.\nFirst of all there is no single risk involved because the transaction is\nstrictly between me and you and you are not going to sabotage me because I\nam asssting you to release your overdue long awaited so you have to protect\nmy interest by keeping it to yourself alone.I don't know if you have\nBitcoin wallet address which I think is the best and safest/ fastest to\nreceive your payment without any delay or hitch.\nThis is a direct remittance into your account, which will not pass through\nany body or office and do not forget that 100 people can fail you but only\none person will succeed you.\nThat is life for you and of course the law of success.  Anyway, let me\nexplain the process of Proxy Disk to you so that you will understand\nexactly what I intend to do for you. Proxy Disk is an instrument used in\nour Apex Bank (CBN) during remittance exercise.\nI will use this type of instrument to remit your funds gradually to you. I\ncan remit about $150,000.00 to $300,000.00  in each round of remittance as\nI stated in my first email! Please note that this is not the same process\nwith usual CENTRAL BANK  (CBN) transfer that takes months and years,\nwithout achieving success.\nThis is a practical process which has been tested and proven, and will be\nwitnessed only by both of us. It takes just few hours to give good result!\nThere are no documents or certificates required for this because I will\nprocess a direct remittance into your account.\nAll I need is to get the Proxy Disk and program your Payment Pin Code into\nit by running it in our Central Computer Hard Disk.\n I will also program your account details to the receiving end of the Disk\nand slot it into the Central Computer System. I will allow it to run\novernight in that position and the result is that an amount not less than\n$150,000.00 to $300,000.00  will be remitted into your account the\nfollowing morning. This is a practical process, which is known to me alone\nas a computer specialist (guru)!  The only thing You have to do for me is\nto send money to purchase the small size of the instrument (Proxy Disk),\nwhich will conveniently remit up to  $150,000.00 to $300,000.00  Later we\ncan buy the bigger size to continue but I want us to get some money into\nyour account first. It is better than wasting time and money to process the\nrelease of your entire amount without achieving success.  There would\nalways be one thing or the other missing if you want to receive your entire\npayment and CBN will hold unto that to delay or cancel your payment. Proxy\nDisk is the only thing we need to buy in this process which will not cost\nmuch.  The instruments is on different capacity and process depending the\none you can afford.\n1,The capacity of the instruction that can remit $150,000.00 to $300,000.00\ncost $6,850.00\n2,The one that can remit $1,000,000.00 to $2,000,000.00 cost $12,730.00\n3,Then from $2,000,000 to $5,000,000.00 and above cost $25,700.00.\nI also want to do this hoping that you will appreciate my help. Please note\nthat your payment is long overdue and if left for longer time, bad CBN and\nother government officials will conspire to divert it for their selfish\ninterest!
