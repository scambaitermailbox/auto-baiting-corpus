It will be my pleasure if i will have your call\ndetails and if possible, WhatSapp which is end to end encrypted for privacy\nreasons.\nThe situation here does not demand that you must come from Peru; it\u2019s the\nduty of the IT manager to configure your information as will be provided by\nyou to the database as the next of Kin to the late owner of the deposited\nconsignment.\nPlease reason with me and if we can go along, send to me your full details\nas it is in any of your government Issued identification, which will do for\nnow for startups.\nOnce your information is configured alongside our late client deposit\ninformation as his next of kin, which might be a member of his family or a\nbusiness partner, then we can be able to raise a new deposit certificate\nthat will bear your full name as the next of kin and wipe out the old\ninformation.
