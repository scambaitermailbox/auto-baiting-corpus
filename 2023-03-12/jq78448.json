So, you MUST stop deflating this move by immediately writing to the paying authority that you are still alive and well as against the lies told by the Saudi Billionaire and his cohorts. Do not doubt this information nor treat it with contempt.\nYou will get to know more about this upon your response because I shall give you all available hidden information as far as I know.
