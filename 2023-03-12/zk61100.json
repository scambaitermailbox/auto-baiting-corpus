I write to seek\nyour consent to carry out a transaction that would be highly beneficial to\nyou and me. I know you may be wondering why I am contacting you for this\ndespite all the friends and relations that I have but I decided to do this\nwith an unknown person to avoid any form of blackmail in the future.\nMr. Alvin Peter Kappelmann Jr was an account holder with my bank. I have\nbeen his account officer for 11 years before his death. He died during the\nWorld Trade Centre bombing in September 11 2001.  Please confirm from this\nsite:\n  http: // www. cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/memorial/people/2632.html\nSince his death, the management of my bank has made series of efforts to\nlocate his family but all efforts were proved abortive. I also carried out\nseries of research to find his family but it was confirmed that the mother\nwho was the only surviving member of the family died at the hearing of the\nfact; no one was able to claim the fund he deposited in my bank legally\nbecause there was no will to it. He had a secret dollar account with my\nbank worth the sum of $58,200,000.00 (Fifty Eight Million, Two Hundred\nThousand United States Dollars) with an interest agreement of 6.7% which\nhave been for the past 9 years.\n  My purpose of contacting you now is this:\nMy bank during the last executive board meeting resolved that if by the\nend of this year and there is no beneficiary to the said account, the\naccount will be confiscated and the fund sent to the bank treasury and\nthis is where I am interested in and wants you to come in:\nI want you to come in as the Next of Kin/Beneficiary to this account. I\nhave all the titled documents to back your claim and as the Vice President\nand Manager of this branch, it is in my power to carry out any form of\nverification on the beneficiary of the said fund and process the fund wire\nwithout any problem. I want you to know that this is legal and 100% risk\nfree as all the titled documents would be changed to your name and the\nfund wired to any bank account you wish to have it wired to.\nPlease note that I am willing to let you have 40% of the total sum while\nyou give me 60% when the fund finally gets to your nominated bank account.\nAlso note that I am willing to go extra mile to make this a success\nbecause if anything goes wrong, then I stand the risk of losing my job and\neven go to jail for trying to carry out such transaction.  This is why I\nam contacting you so that we can put heads together and take care of this\ntransaction within now and the next 9 days.\nKindly get back to me immediately so that I advice you on how this would\nbe carried out.Reply all email to; \ninfo.edkong@gmail.com\nSincerely,\nMr. Edward Kong\n", "From: e********1@gmail.com\nTo: zk61100@m**************m\nTime: 2023-03-18 12:57:50\nSUBJECT: My Dear Friend & Confidant,\nMy Dear Friend & Confidant,\nThank you so much for your prompt reply to my mail.

I have to at this point\nask for your sincere confidentiality, please assure me this and keep\nto it that the next person to you do not know about this transaction\nas we have to keep it highly confidential. You should know that I am\nworking with the bank and a manager in that matter hence my position\nand job will be at risk should any body know l am the one given you\ninformation's and data.\nThe basic requirement here is that as you will know I do not want to\nlet my bank know I am behind the transfer so all our communications\nwill be restricted to email unless on a very urgent matter then you\ncan reach me on my direct telephone number and if it is convenient to\ndiscuss with you at the particular time, then we will discuss and if\nit is not safe for us to discuss, then I will call you immediately it\nis convenient for me to talk with you.\nI want to make something clear to you, the fact that I am the Vice\nPresident and the Manager of this branch does not guarantee the\nsecurity of this transaction, whatever we are doing must be done under\na very high level of confidentiality.

I write to seek\nyour consent to carry out a transaction that would be highly beneficial to\nyou and me. I know you may be wondering why I am contacting you for this\ndespite all the friends and relations that I have but I decided to do this\nwith an unknown person to avoid any form of blackmail in the future.\nMr. Alvin Peter Kappelmann Jr was an account holder with my bank. I have\nbeen his account officer for 11 years before his death. He died during the\nWorld Trade Centre bombing in September 11 2001.  Please confirm from this\nsite:\n  http: // www. cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/memorial/people/2632.html\nSince his death, the management of my bank has made series of efforts to\nlocate his family but all efforts were proved abortive. I also carried out\nseries of research to find his family but it was confirmed that the mother\nwho was the only surviving member of the family died at the hearing of the\nfact; no one was able to claim the fund he deposited in my bank legally\nbecause there was no will to it. He had a secret dollar account with my\nbank worth the sum of $58,200,000.00 (Fifty Eight Million, Two Hundred\nThousand United States Dollars) with an interest agreement of 6.7% which\nhave been for the past 9 years.\n  My purpose of contacting you now is this:\nMy bank during the last executive board meeting resolved that if by the\nend of this year and there is no beneficiary to the said account, the\naccount will be confiscated and the fund sent to the bank treasury and\nthis is where I am interested in and wants you to come in:\nI want you to come in as the Next of Kin/Beneficiary to this account. I\nhave all the titled documents to back your claim and as the Vice President\nand Manager of this branch, it is in my power to carry out any form of\nverification on the beneficiary of the said fund and process the fund wire\nwithout any problem. I want you to know that this is legal and 100% risk\nfree as all the titled documents would be changed to your name and the\nfund wired to any bank account you wish to have it wired to.\nPlease note that I am willing to let you have 40% of the total sum while\nyou give me 60% when the fund finally gets to your nominated bank account.\nAlso note that I am willing to go extra mile to make this a success\nbecause if anything goes wrong, then I stand the risk of losing my job and\neven go to jail for trying to carry out such transaction.  This is why I\nam contacting you so that we can put heads together and take care of this\ntransaction within now and the next 9 days.\nKindly get back to me immediately so that I advice you on how this would\nbe carried out.Reply all email to; \ninfo.edkong@gmail.com\nSincerely,\nMr. Edward Kong\n", "direction": "Inbound"}, {"time": "1678990358", "subject": "SUBJECT: Re: Dear Sir,", "body": "That sounds not really well, but I think I can do something helpful.\n", "direction": "Outbound"}, {"time": "1679144270", "subject": "SUBJECT: My Dear Friend & Confidant,", "body": "My Dear Friend & Confidant,\nThank you so much for your prompt reply to my mail.

I have to at this point\nask for your sincere confidentiality, please assure me this and keep\nto it that the next person to you do not know about this transaction\nas we have to keep it highly confidential. You should know that I am\nworking with the bank and a manager in that matter hence my position\nand job will be at risk should any body know l am the one given you\ninformation's and data.\nThe basic requirement here is that as you will know I do not want to\nlet my bank know I am behind the transfer so all our communications\nwill be restricted to email unless on a very urgent matter then you\ncan reach me on my direct telephone number and if it is convenient to\ndiscuss with you at the particular time, then we will discuss and if\nit is not safe for us to discuss, then I will call you immediately it\nis convenient for me to talk with you.\nI want to make something clear to you, the fact that I am the Vice\nPresident and the Manager of this branch does not guarantee the\nsecurity of this transaction, whatever we are doing must be done under\na very high level of confidentiality.

I reside in 3202 Linden\nPl,Flushing NY\n11354 and would want us to meet but our meeting will be under a very\nhigh surveillance to avoid being seen together until this is over.

My bank will have\nthis approved since everything about this deposit is with me and the\nfund in my branch.\nOn no account must you discuss this with anyone; whatever you want to\nask me please do that by email and I will answer you immediately.

Please do\nnot call me on my office telephone number because it will be unsecured\nto discuss this transaction in my office. Calling me on my office\ntelephone number would mean a stop to this transaction.\nYour full name\nHouse/ officer address\nTel.\nOccupation.\nAge.\nMarital status.\nIdentification  .
