I resumed to this office on the 19th of February, 2023 and during my official research I discovered an abandoned consignment box containing an undisclosed US Dollars belonging to you as the legitimate beneficiary. Your contact email is tagged on the consignment.  \nFrom my assumption, the consignment contains not less than US$7.5million and it weighs approximately 35kg (Internal dimension: W58 x H146 x D72 (cm) effective Capacity: 560 L) and It is still left in our airport storage facility. Your consignment has its clearance documents, which includes Anti-Terrorist Clearance, Money Laundry Clearance, United Nations Approval Certificate, I.M.F Approval Certificate, and World Bank Approval Certificate.\nThe consignment was sent from the United Kingdom by Barclays Bank London. I tried to know the reason why your consignment is still abandoned here in our airport, and I found out that the former operation manager who left this office recently, with-held your consignment for his own selfish interest despite that your diplomat presented your supporting documents to him, he still withheld your consignment for no just cause.\nI do not support injustice and criminality, and now that I have become the new Operation Manager of George Bush Intercontinental Airport and in charge of your consignment, I will release your consignment to you because I do not see any reason why your consignment should be withheld since all your documents are complete. Therefore, kindly come to our airport to claim your consignment from my office.\nI look forward to your response.\nYours faithfully\nMr. Albert Nicholas\nOperation Manager\nGeorge Bush Intercontinental Airport\n2800 N Terminal Rd, Houston,TX 77032,\nUnited States\nTel: +1(432) 214 2079 Call/SMS   \n", "From: a***************6@outlook.com\nTo: ap51187@m**************m\nTime: 2023-03-24 15:55:27\nSUBJECT: Re:   George Bush Intercontinental\nGeorge Bush Intercontinental Airport\n2800 N Terminal Rd, Houston,\nTX 77032, United States\nAttn: Mrs Marry Wilson,\nI received your email and the content is well noted.
