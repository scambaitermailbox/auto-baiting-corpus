I have been a member of the Scotiabank Board of Directors since 2016.\nI firmly feel that God has placed you in my path at this precise moment. You will find this crucial business conversation interesting since you will gain from it, so I want to share it with you.\nThe estate of a respected client and friend who passed away recently is being administered by me, and it is estimated to be worth $77,000,000.00 (seventy seven million USD).\nAlthough he selected me as executor, knowing full well that I would have the authority to make any choices in the event of a sudden death, there was apparently no mention of an heir or next of kin in any of the estate project agreements with the bank from the outset.\nKnowing him for years, the fact that he never married, never had children, never introduced any form of family to me or the bank until his passing left me in a precarious and perplexed situation. The bank management asked the executor to provide instructions last week regarding what to do with the decedent's abandoned estate. As his executor, I am not permitted by law to inherit from, divert from, or claim this estate or any of its assets, but I am permitted to make decisions on whoever I deem to be a reasonably competent and capable claimant.\nI contacted you and am now requesting your cooperation to present you for the claim as a trustee because I have been looking for the ideal business-minded individual to share this ideas with and possibly present the individual for the claim. If I am unable to find a deserving individual for the claim, my bank's board of directors will not hesitate to divert the funds to their own selfish uses. Since the transaction will be carried out in accordance with a valid agreement that will safeguard you from any risks, there is no risk involved. Since the bank directors are already wealthy, it is preferable for us to take possession of the funds than to let them do so. I don't have a greedy nature, so I propose splitting the money 50/50 between the two parties. My share will help me to make a difference in the lives of many people who are dying, and I know the asset's owner would be happy if it wasn't mishandled or used for my own gain.\nAs soon as you let me know what you think about this, I'll reply with more information about the next steps in my response. Please keep this a secret between the two of us only until everything is formally arranged.\nPlease reply through my private email\nScottThomsonscotiabank@gmail.com\nGod bless you, and have a goo   \n", "From: s********************k@gmail.com\nTo: rl01018@m**************m\nTime: 2023-04-04 17:20:06\nSUBJECT: Re: Hello,\nGood to hear from you,\nI have received your email and have taken note of all of its contents.\nI assume you are knowledgeable, but I must remind you that this proposal is\na legal procedure that is carried out through a probate process.
