As a person of legal age, I regret to inform you that due to my illness, I cannot engage in many activities that I used to enjoy. Despite this, I have been running an orphanage and charity home while actively involved in philanthropic work. In honor of my late husband's memory, I am seeking a friend, companion, or church to continue this noble cause. I want to assure you that our charitable work is genuine, and you can verify our orphanage foundations' reputation, which is registered with the Secretary of States of Arkansas government.\nVolunteering and helping the less privileged is a passion that my late husband and I shared. While we were fortunate to gather wealth, my illness has made me realize the importance of leaving a positive impact on the world. As a Christian, I believe that it is our duty to care for one another, especially the less privileged, and make the world a better place. I am seeking a confidant, humble friend, and companion to help me in my last moments and bequeath this project unto you in continuity towards orphans, widows, and the less privileged.\nAfter losing my husband eight years ago, I have no children to inherit my assets. However, I wish to donate them to help the less privileged. Unfortunately, my husband's family has been cruel to me, which has left me feeling cold and lonely. I hope that you can be the person willing to continue our philanthropic work, and I have a life insurance policy deposited by my late husband with a European finance company, which I want to use to help disabled children, motherless homes, and organizations that help the poor. The medical experts have given me a few months to live, and I want to fulfill my late husband's dream before my departure from this world.\nIf you are interested in helping me in this noble cause, I would appreciate your support. I will reveal more details if you agree to proceed with me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\nSincerely,\nRev. Vanessa Brooks.\n", "From: v*************0@att.net\nTo: ze24718@m**************m\nTime: 2023-03-15 05:22:56\nSUBJECT: Re: Dear friend,\nDear Barlow, \nI am grateful for your assistance and teamwork on this project, and I hope you fully understand the content of this letter. If we agree to work together, we will need to exchange vital information to become more familiar with each other. I assure you that this charity fund delivery to you is risk-free, and my late husband's legal and financial consultant will ensure that all necessary documents are legally processed in your name to obtain the trunk box.\nAfter much prayer, I have decided to continue this project with you because I was looking for an honest and God-fearing person to use this fund for the right purpose. My husband's family and relatives have been quarreling and killing each other, and they even attempted to murder me before my death because of my husband's wealth. I escaped their evil plans, but I have no choice but to take this risk entrusting such a charity fund project to a stranger. This is my last resort as I have less than four weeks to live, and I cannot let my husband's dream fade away or allow his family or the government to find out about this deposited charity fund.\nCommunication is crucial in this kind of transaction, especially with me, given the limited time I have left. The distance between us does not matter as long as we adhere to the instructions. My late husband and I were both involved in charity organization work before his death, and after his death, the organization continued until I was stricken with this strange illness. The reason I contacted you is that you will stand in my place to make a good foundation named after my late husband and me (Dr. & Mrs. Brooks Faith Foundation). If I pass away, the foundation's goal is to donate the fund to charity, orphanages, disabled and less privileged, and widows worldwide.\nThis is a great deal I am offering you, and I believe you are mature enough to understand all I am saying.

Be assured that this transaction is legitimate and trouble-free, and all that is required from you is absolute privacy as regards this transaction.
