I hope this message finds you in good health and in high spirits. I am  Mrs. Paul Maxwell Lee   - my husband was a philanthropist who believed in helping those in need, but he sadly passed away from cancer. Before his death, he made me vow to continue his legacy and use the funds he had set aside to help the poor and needy. Now, unfortunately, I too have been diagnosed with cancer and have only a few weeks left to live\nI am writing to ask for your help in fulfilling my husband's wishes and continuing his legacy - I have chosen to set up a foundation in his name to use the funds for charitable causes. The amount is 6.4 million USD in American currency, but it could have an enormous impact if utilized appropriately. Please consider taking up the mantle of carrying on my husband's legacy - it would mean so much to me if you responded positively to this letter.\nI believe that my late husband would have wanted his wealth to be used for the betterment of society. This is because our marriage was fruitless. Donations have been made to the American Red Cross, as well as to my country, Japan and I trust that you will honor his wishes. I understand that this may be a difficult decision for you to make, but please know that your efforts will significantly impact the lives of many people. Thank you again for taking the time to read my letter - your consideration means so much!  \nWarm regards.\nMrs. Paul Maxwell Lee    \n", "From: m************3@gmail.com\nTo: yv55225@m**************m\nTime: 2023-03-30 16:57:18\nSUBJECT: Re: 14035 Dartmouth Path Rosemou\nI am sorry for the late response my health is terrible and I have a few\nweeks to live according to the recent reports from my medical practitioners\nI will be going for emergency surgery and I have already given out $ 1\nmillion dollars to the American Red Cross (center-foundation.org/\n<http://centre-foundation.org/>) and I have to send the sum of $5,000000 to\nyou through the bank where the charity fund is kept and you are to take\n25%  of the fund as my benefactor and the 70% is for the charity work and\n5% Expenses.\n I have to remind you that I will be going for surgery below is the bank\nmanager's contact and email and write to him that you are a benefactor of Mrs.\nPaul Maxwell Lee\nName...
