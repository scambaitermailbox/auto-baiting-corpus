I still have dealer\ninformation in India, but I don't want to give their information to\nthe American Company to avoid them knowing the actual price. your duty\nwill be to get the material from the local dealer and supply to the\nAmerican Company, then we (you and I ) will share the profit made on\nthe basis of 60% for you and 40% for me.\nYour role must be played perfectly and the least I will expect from\nyou is betrayal.
